# Image Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on initiating a machine learning project for image classification, specifically comparing the performance of the Vision Transformer and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The experiment is conducted using Google Colab as the environment, and the CIFAR-100 image dataset is employed to train both models. The models are implemented using Keras and TensorFlow in Python.

## Objectives

- **Model Comparison:** Evaluate and compare the performance of the Vision Transformer and CNN in image classification.

- **Dataset:** Utilize the CIFAR-100 image dataset for training both models.

- **Tools:** Implement the models using Keras and TensorFlow in Python.

## Experiment Results

The experiment revealed that, with a dataset of 60,000 images, the CNN demonstrated slightly better performance than the Vision Transformer overall.
